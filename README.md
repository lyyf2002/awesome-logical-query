## :scroll: Categorization of papers

#### Modalities

- Triple-based KGs
- Hyper-relational KGs
- Hyper-graphs

#### Reasoning Domain

- Discrete (Entities only)
- Discrete Temporal (Entities + Dates)
- Discrete + Continuous (Entities + string/numerical Literals)

#### Logical Expressiveness

- EPFO
- EPFO + Negation queries
- OWL profiles (+ class / relation axioms)

#### Learning

- Transductive
- Inductive (limited)
- Inductive

#### Modeling

- Pure Neural
- Neural + Geometric
- Neuro-symbolic
- Symbolic

#### Query Patterns

- Fixed patterns from specific datasets
- Arbitrary query DAGs

### Query Operators

- JOIN (intersection)
- UNION 
- NOT (negation)
- FILTER over discrete outputs (filtering entities)
- FILTER over discrete + continuous outputs (+ filtering literals)
- AGGREGATIONS (GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc)

#### Return Type (Projections)

- Final node only
- Arbitrary non-anchor nodes

#### Training

- End-to-end trainable
- Inference-only (decoders)

#### Metrics

- Generalization: predicting hard answers (MRR / Hits@k)
- Generalization: from ranking to binary classification
- Entailment: faithfulness - ability to recover easy answers (no link prediction) (MRR / Hits@k)
- Estimating the cardinality of answer set size (Spearman's rank correlation, MAPE)
- Predicting easy answers before hard answers (ROC-AUC)
